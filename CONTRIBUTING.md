## Ways to Contribute

see ./docs/conflict-analysis-guidelines.txt for advice on how to contribute to conflict resolution content and analysis.

### Translation Contributions

Translations are crucial for reaching a global audience. Here's how to help with translations:

#### Translation Process
1. **Language Proficiency**
   - Must be fluent in both English and the target language
   - Understanding of cultural context is essential
   - Familiarity with peace-related terminology is valuable

2. **Translation Steps**
   - Check `messages` directory for existing translations
   - Create new language file if needed (e.g., `fr.json` for French)
   - Ensure all keys match the English version (`en.json`)
   - Add translated content while maintaining the JSON structure

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Back translation: Have another translator translate back to English to verify accuracy
   - Cultural review: Ensure content is culturally appropriate
   - Technical review: Verify format and structure match the source
   - Context review: Ensure translations make sense in context of peace-building

4. **Translation Verification**
   For new translations or significant changes, please provide:
   - Your qualifications/experience with the language
   - Any relevant cultural context considerations
   - Notes about specific translation choices
